# Angular Intro
The goal of this assignment is to update the index.html file to add a new person to the array and display the first name, last name, and shoutout in their own row.

## Stretch

- Each person has a github account being added, but it is not being used anywhere. Make it so that when someone clicks on a name, they are brought to that user's github account. It may help to research `ng-href` in order to do this.
- Include a search bar that allows a user to a find a person by their first name, last name, or shoutout (if what they type matches any of those fields for a user, show the user). It may help to research angular's ng-repeat filters (they look like this `| filter:`), in order to do this.
- Serve these files from a server to `localhost:5000` with `npm start`
- Move the array to a mongo database and research `$http` in order to query the data from the database
